# Purpose: Launch instructions for Fuelbed Dynamics Model (FDM), a landscape-fire-succession model built to model fire,

# NOTE: the launch code is set to work with the eScience Institute AWS account and your personal AWS account. 
# However, the .sh and .awk files must be handled differently.
# Read below for differences in handling these launch files.
# This account is only to be used for testing. Once you are ready to conduct model runs contact

# Where:
# Arg 1: InstancesToLaunch = the number of runs
# Arg 2: use_gpu = TRUE/FALSE; whether or not to use the graphics card processor (unless you have figured out a way to enable the GPU, which I haven't done as of 2/16/2017, this should be FALSE.
# Arg 3: rx_fire = the annual number of acres burned by prescribed fire
# Arg 4: install_packages = TRUE/FALSE; whether or not R should install packages. Unless you are storing the packages this should be TRUE, as of 2/26/2017, script requires this to be TRUE.
# Arg 5: disturbance_regime = MANUAL: manually input disturbance regime parameters (sef_FDM_v2.0.r) in the r script (YEARS = number of simulation years in run; THINNING = number of acres to thin annually; HERBICIDE = 
         number of acreas to apply herbicide to for hardwood control annually; RX_FIRE = number of acres to apply prescribed fire to annually; NATURAL_FIRE_ROTATION = two values: 1) number of years it takes 
         for wildfires to burn 100% of acres on base and 2) number of years it takes for wildfires to burn 100% of acres in buffer zone; MEAN_FIRE_SIZE = two values: 1) average size of fire (in acres) on base 
         and 2) average size of fires (in acres) in buffer zone; STAND_DEV_FIRE_SIZE = two values: 1) standard deviation of fire sizes on base and 2) standard deviation of fire sizes in buffer zone).
