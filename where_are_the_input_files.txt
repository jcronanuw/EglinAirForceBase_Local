GitHub has started regulating file size in repositories and does not permit files greater than 25 MB. This means that input files
should be stored elsewhere. Best option for this is to create a mirror directory for GitHub repositories on Box/Pinyon
and sync them with the Desktop application on any machine that is running scripts on the GitHub repo.
Input files for this repository can be found at
